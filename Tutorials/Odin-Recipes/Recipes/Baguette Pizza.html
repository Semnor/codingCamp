  <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 French baguette</li>

      <li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 ounces cooked and crumbled sausage</li>
      <li>2 ounces mini pepperoni slices</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
